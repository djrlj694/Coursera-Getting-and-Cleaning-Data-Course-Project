# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Background

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

## Grading

The following submissions are required for grading:

1.  A tidy data set as described below;
2. A link to a GitHub repository with the script for performing the analysis;
3. A code book (CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data;
4. A README.md explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
