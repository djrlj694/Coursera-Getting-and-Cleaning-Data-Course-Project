# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Background

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing (for example, see [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/)). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Instructions

Create one R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Grading

The student will be graded by peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. The following submissions are required for grading:

1. A tidy data set as in **Instructions**;
2. A link to a GitHub repository with the script for performing the analysis;
3. A code book (`CodeBook.md`) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data;
4. A `README.md` explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
